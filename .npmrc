# NOTE: These are pnpm config keys, not npm config keys.
# Keeping them in .npmrc causes npm (and tools that shell out to npm) to warn.
# If you want these behaviors for pnpm, set them via one of:
# - `pnpm config set link-workspace-packages true`
# - `pnpm config set prefer-workspace-packages true`
# (in your user-level pnpm config), or configure in CI as needed.

# link-workspace-packages=true
# prefer-workspace-packages=true
